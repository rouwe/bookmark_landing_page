## My process

### _Semantic_

I started by creating a sketch on how the general layout of each major section should look like and the semantic HTML elements that I will be needing. I also need to think about how to make the most out of flexbox for mobile and desktop view of the page.

### _User Interface_

The first step that I have done is to make the user interface of the page for the mobile view using HTML and CSS.

### _Interactivity_

The next step is to make the page interactive by using Javascript.
I just repeatedly do the process while also making some minor adjustment.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla Javascript
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Throughout the process of building this page, I managed to reinforce my knowledge on HTML, CSS and Javascript. Working with SVG is pretty new to me, so I needed to do a some research to make things work. Working with Vanilla JS is challenging and fun as well. The most important thing that I learned is that I still have a lot to learn.

### Continued development

I want to focus more on HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://w3schools.com/) - This is helped me a lot when I need some kind of simple and straight to the point reference.
- [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web) - I used this whenever I needed to dive deeper into some topic.
